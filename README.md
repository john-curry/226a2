Find the minimum and maximum value in a list using the information theoretic lower bound for number of comparisons. Algorithms and Data Structures assignment.

There is a trick that I missed on this assignment that greatly simplifies the code but I just hard-coded a very dirty solution for when there is 3 number to be compared.
